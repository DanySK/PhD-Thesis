abstract = {The term computer simulation is related to the usage of a computational model in order to improve the understanding of a system's behavior and/or to evaluate strategies for its operation, in explanatory or predictive schemes. There are cases in which practical or ethical reasons make it impossible to realize direct observations: in these cases, the possibility of realizing 'in-machina' experiments may represent the only way to study, analyze and evaluate models of those realities. Different situations and systems are characterized by the presence of autonomous entities whose local behaviors (actions and interactions) determine the evolution of the overall system; agent-based models are particularly suited to support the definition of models of such systems, but also to support the design and implementation of simulators. Agent-Based models and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been adopted to simulate very different kinds of complex systems, from the simulation of socio-economic systems to the elaboration of scenarios for logistics optimization, from biological systems to urban planning. This paper discusses the specific aspects of this approach to modeling and simulation from the perspective of Informatics, describing the typical elements of an agent-based simulation model and the relevant research.},

    abstract = {With Systems Biology, a promising new application area for modeling and simulation emerges. Today's biologists are facing huge amounts of data delivered at different levels of detail by a multitude of advanced experimentation techniques. The Systems Biology approach copes with this information by cycling through phases of forming hypothesis, constructing models, experimenting with or analyzing these models, and validating the findings by wet-lab experiments. A crucial point is therefore the way in which the knowledge about a system is formalized, i.e., how a biological system is described as this constrains the perception of the system as well as scope of possible answers the model might provide. In this article, we compare different discrete-event modeling formalisms (Petri Nets, Stochastic Pi-Calculus , StateCharts, and Devs) regarding their applicability to a cell biological system of current research interest, the Wnt signaling pathway. We then introduce the popular Gillespie algorithm, which is the foundation of many discrete-event simulators for molecular-biological systems, and elaborate on some interesting extensions.},

  abstract = {The time evolution of species concentrations in biochemical reaction networks is often modeled using the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) [Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2340 (1977)]. The computational cost of the original SSA scaled linearly with the number of reactions in the network. Gibson and Bruck developed a logarithmic scaling version of the SSA which uses a priority queue or binary tree for more efficient reaction selection [Gibson and Bruck, J. Phys. Chem. A 104, 1876 (2000)]. More generally, this problem is one of dynamic discrete random variate generation which finds many uses in kinetic Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation. We present here a constant-time algorithm, whose cost is independent of the number of reactions, enabled by a slightly more complex underlying data structure. While applicable to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in general, we describe the algorithm in the context of biochemical simulations and demonstrate its competitive performance on small- and medium-size networks, as well as its superior constant-time performance on very large networks, which are becoming necessary to represent the increasing complexity of biochemical data for pathways that mediate cell function.}

The key result of this article is that general-purpose chemical reactions inspired by population dynamics can be used in pervasive applications to enact spatial computing patterns of competition and gradient-based interaction.},

        abstract = {Emerging network scenarios call for innovative open service frameworks to ensure capability of self-adaptability and long-lasting evolvability. In this paper, we assess the need for such innovative service frameworks, and discuss how their engineering should get inspiration from natural ecosystems, i.e., by modelling services as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services and data sources. We introduce a reference conceptual architecture with the goal of clarifying the concepts expressed and framing the several possible nature-inspired metaphors that could be adopted to realise the idea. On this basis, we go into details about one of such possible approaches, in which the rules governing the ecosystem are inspired by biochemical mechanisms. A case study is also introduced to exemplify the potentials of the presented biochemical approach and to experiment with some representative biochemistry-inspired patterns of adaptive service organisation and evolution.

    abstract = {The number of software packages for kinetic modeling of biochemical networks continues to grow. Although most packages share a common core of functionality, the specific capabilities and user interfaces of different packages mean that choosing the best package for a given task is not trivial. We compare 12 software packages with respect to their functionality, reliability, efficiency, user-friendliness and compatibility. Although most programs performed reliably in all numerical tasks tested, {SBML} compatibility and the set-up of multicompartmentalization are problematic in many packages. For simple models, {GEPASI} seems the best choice for non-expert users. For large-scale models, environments such as {Jarnac/JDesigner} are preferable, because they allow modular implementation of models. Virtual Cell is the most versatile program and provides the simplest and clearest functionality for setting up multicompartmentalization.},

Therefore, there is a big need for software tools that allow access to diverse simulation and modeling methods as well as support for the usage of these methods.Results: Here, we present COPASI, a platform-independent and user-friendly biochemical simulator that offers several unique features. We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministicÐstochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation.Availability: The complete software is available in binary (executable) for MS Windows, OS X, Linux (Intel) and Sun Solaris (SPARC), as well as the full source code under an open source license from http://www.copasi.org.Contact:mendes@vbi.vt.edu},

    abstract = {Mathematical models are increasingly used to understand how phenotypes emerge from systems of molecular interactions. However, their current construction as monolithic sets of equations presents a fundamental barrier to progress. Overcoming this requires modularity, enabling sub-systems to be specified independently and combined incrementally, and abstraction, enabling generic properties of biological processes to be specified independently of specific instances. These, in turn, require models to be represented as programs rather than as datatypes. Programmable modularity and abstraction enables libraries of modules to be created, which can be instantiated and reused repeatedly in different contexts with different components. We have developed a computational infrastructure that accomplishes this. We show here why such capabilities are needed, what is required to implement them and what can be accomplished with them that could not be done previously.},

    abstract = {Real environments in which agents operate are inherently dynamic—the environment changes beyond the agents' control. We advocate that, for multi-agent simulation, this dynamism must be modeled explicitly as part of the simulated environment, preferably using concepts and constructs that relate to the real world. In this paper, we describe such concepts and constructs, and we provide a formal framework to unambiguously specify their relations and meaning. We apply the formal framework to model a dynamic {RoboCup} Soccer environment and elaborate on how the framework poses new challenges for exploring the modeling of environments in multi-agent simulation.},

I have introduced a new chapter at the beginning of the thesis, which includes a new schema, classifies the subsequent contributions and also includes the list of publications I have contributed to.

Chapter 5 have been merged into Chapter 4, that now describes all the less scientific and more implementative aspects of alchemist.

I have made clear in the background part that we abuse the word pattern a little bit, and we call "pattern" those that are "spatial patterns".

Fig 3.1 (was 2.1)  has been modified to better fit the thesis, and the BIO-CORE paper has been properly referenced.
